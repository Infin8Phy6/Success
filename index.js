      "explanation": "Negative reinforcement removes unpleasant stimuli to encourage behavior, whereas punishment seeks to decrease or suppress undesired behavior."

      "correctAnswer": "Extinction gradually reduces the conditioned response when reinforcement stops.",
      "explanation": "Extinction occurs when the conditioned stimulus no longer elicits the conditioned response due to a lack of reinforcement."
